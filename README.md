# IngenieroCannabico

Website developed for my Web Development Course of Coderhouse. Now it's going to be online and it's a personal portfolio for the 
Agronomist Engineer Rodrigo Maltz who specializes in education and advice on projects related to cannabis in Argentina. 

This website was entirely developed by me using html, css-sass, javascript and jquery.
